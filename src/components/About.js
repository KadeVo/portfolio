      <p>
        I graduated with a Bachelor of Business and transitioned my career after
        uncovering my passion for software development whilst I was coding as a
        hobby. I ended up falling in love with problem solving and the art of
        creation. I decided to enroll into Dev Academy where they gave me
        hands-on experience in a team environment.This hands-on experience
        allowed me to cultivate my skills, not just as an individual coder, but
        as a collaborative team player. I took on challenges that mirrored
        real-world scenarios, honing my ability to solve complex problems while
        working seamlessly within a team. I am enthusiastic about creating
        innovative solutions and contributing to meaningful projects. I am not
        just a developer; I am a passionate problem solver, a team collaborator,
        and a lifelong learner who wants to make a change. I recently deployed a
